# üéâ Welcome to My Learning Log!

&nbsp;

This is the very first post using my new setup!

If you're seeing this, it means Markdown rendering and metadata parsing are working properly.  
This post is here to demonstrate how Markdown formatting works in a learning-log/blog setup.

## The Power of MDX

MDX allows you to use interactive React components directly inside your Markdown files. This blends the simplicity of writing in Markdown with the power of React.

### 1. Interactive Components

Here is a simple interactive counter. It's a client-side component that maintains its own state.

<InteractiveCounter />

### 2. Components with Props

You can pass props to your components to change their appearance or behavior. Here's a `Callout` component with different `type` props:

<Callout type="info">
  **Did you know?** MDX allows you to create reusable, dynamic content blocks like this one.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Warning:** With great power comes great responsibility. Too many complex components can slow down your page.
</Callout>

<Callout type="idea">
  **Idea:** You could use this to create tutorial callouts, author bios, or even product cards!
</Callout>

### 3. Using Logic in Your Content

You can even use JavaScript variables and logic right in your post. We can't export variables directly from here, but we can pass in components that contain logic.

For example, here's a component that renders the current date: <Today />

This is just scratching the surface, but it demonstrates how MDX can make your content more engaging and dynamic than standard Markdown.

## üõ†Ô∏è Markdown Basics

You can do things like:

- **Bold text** with `**bold**`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*`
- Inline code like `let x = 5;`
- Code blocks:

````js
// JavaScript example
function sayHi(name) {
  console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
}
