This post is here to demonstrate how Markdown formatting works in a learning-log/blog setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Markdown Basics

You can do things like:

- **Bold text** with `**bold**`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*`
- Inline code like `let x = 5;`
- Code blocks:

````js
// JavaScript example
function sayHi(name) {
  console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
}
