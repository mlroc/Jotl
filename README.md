# Jotl - A Local-First, File-Based Publishing Engine

Jotl is a lightweight, developer-focused publishing engine built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It empowers you to manage content via local Markdown files in a Git-based workflow, blending the simplicity of Markdown with the power of interactive React components.

## Features

- **Git-Based Workflow:** Manage your content with the version control you already use.
- **MDX Support:** Embed interactive React components directly in your posts.
- **Developer-Centric Tooling:** Includes a CLI script to create new posts instantly.
- **Themeable & Responsive:** Dark/light mode and a polished mobile experience out of the box.
- **Fast & SEO-Friendly:** Built with Next.js for static site generation.

## Creating a New Post

You can quickly create a new post using the provided CLI script.

```bash
npm run new-post "Your New Post Title"
